## üì¶ Installation Methods

### Method A: Automated Installation (Recommended)

Use our simple shell script for a one-click installation experience:

```bash
# Download and run the recommended installation script
curl -sSL https://github.com/Molesafenetwork/OEMSSDPROD.sh | bash
```
```bash
# if script downloads but isnt executable use this
chmod +x oemssdprod.sh
./oemssdprod.sh
```

**What the script does:**
- Sets up encryption keys automatically
- Configures admin commands
- Guides you through `.env` configuration
- Handles all dependencies and setup

**Available installation scripts:**
- `oemssdprod.sh` - **Recommended** for production environments
- Other scripts available for different hardware configurations

---

### Method B: Manual Installation

For users who prefer manual setup or need custom configurations:

#### Step 1: Generate Encryption Key

Use Node.js and crypto.js to generate a secure encryption key:

```bash
node -e "const CryptoJS = require('crypto-js'); const key = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(32); console.log(key.toString());"
```

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Copy the generated encryption key and update your `.env` file:

```bash
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-generated-key-here
# Update other variables according to your needs
```

#### Step 3: Verify Configuration

- Check [`.bash_history`](/.bash_history) for crypto.js key generation details
- Review [`.env`](/.env) file for proper configuration layout
- Ensure all variables correspond to your requirements

**Note:** All generated data is stored in the `.data` directory and remains private, but encryption is still recommended for security.
